In this post we discuss the issues of attaining knowledge without absolute certainty.
In particular, we discuss two similar ideas from philosophy of science: (i) the idea of
*fallibilism* promoted by Charles Sanders Pierce, and (ii) the idea of *falsifiability* promoted
by Karl Popper.
We argue that, in some cases, falsified scientific knowledge does not lose its epistemological and scientific value.
These cases are witnessed when an improvement of the initial body of knowledge survives the process of refutation.
Thus, the new tentative conjecture is an improved version of the initial, falsified, one,
which implies that its refutation is not final.


Fallibism was used by Charles Sanders Pierce to express the idea that it is not possible to
attain absolute certainty regarding questions of fact.
In philosophy of science, this implies that all scientific claims are open to revision in light of
new evidence, and certainty regarding scientific phenomenona can not be achieved.
In laymen terms, Popper describes the belief in scientific certainty, and in the authority of science, as "wishful thinking".


Nonetheless, this claim shall not be interpreted as skepticism towards the role science plays in epistemology.
But rather as a basis for the idea that an errorless truth may not be attainable, and that science
is fallible (because science is human).
Popper further developed a refutation to previous opinions about scientific (and epistemological) advancements -- such as empiricism, inductivism, or logical positivism -- which claim that scientific evidence comes from observations confirming a conjecture, or by verifying it through
direct observation. We note that such views only account for evidence supporting scientific claims,
and not for evidence refuting them.
Therefore, they hold that certainty can be achieved through observation.

In contrast, Popper proposed that scientific evidence (and the knowledge derived from it) never has
absolute value, but it is (at its best) not *yet* refuted.
This state is defined as *falsifiable*. When a conjecture is falsifiable, it is not false, but does
not give irrefutable evidence for a scientific question.
However, a conjecture can be refuted by *one* counter-example obtain through observations, experiments or theoretical
constructs.
When a counter-example is found, the conjecture is declared false, and new falsifiable alternatives shall be sought.
This accounts for the view that no number of positive outcomes can confirm a conjecture, but a single counter-example
can prove the opposite.
In Popper's framework, the scientific endeavour can be framed as an evolutionary process consisting of the following steps.
Firstly, tentative conjectures are proposed, followed by the elimination of erroneous conjectures, and the proposal
of a candidate solution (for which a refutation was not yet found).
However, once a refutation is found, the candidate solution is declared false and the process restarts.

Nonetheless, there are cases when the iterative process reuses elements from past tentative conjectures (meanwhile falsified).
In such cases, are past falsified conjectures, which act as building blocks of falsifiable conjectures, really false?
We argue that they are not completely false, but are *partially falsified* by the counter-examples presented.
Therefore, they still hold scientific (and epistemological) value.
Moreover, in some cases they also hold materialistic value; when they are used in engineering projects, or when
the initial problem is framed under different constraints.
One such example is the Newtonian mechanics, which was refuted by Einstein's relativity theory, although has great value in a variety of engineering projects.

Does this mean that the falsification of a conjecture is relative?
No, but rather that the repetition of a falsified conjecture does not imply its final refutation.
Moreover, it means that knowledge does not require absolute certainty.
And there are multiple reasons to accept more uncertainty, while gaining practical benefits.
Nonetheless, from a scientific point of view, the partial refutation of a conjecture should re-start
the process of finding tentative alternatives.
